scrum_ui
=====

While reading [Lightweight Django by Julia Elman and Mark Lavin (Oâ€™Reilly). Copyright 2014 Julia Elman and Mark Lavin. 978-1-4919-4594-0.](http://www.amazon.com/Lightweight-Django-Julia-Elman/dp/149194594X/) I coded the "scrum" example for practice and saved here for reference.

In the book, the ui is built into the scrum project with templates in the board app. I wanted clear separation of UI from the API, so making this scrum-ui a standalone app that's meant to connect to the API.
